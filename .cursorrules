# Tribunal Documentation Project Learnings

## Project Context
This project involves preparing professional legal documents for a tribunal case against Murray & Currie letting agency in Scotland. The case concerns:
1. An unprotected pet deposit of £200 that was applied to the final rent payment rather than being returned
2. Multiple breaches of the Letting Agent Code of Practice
3. GDPR violations (failure to respond to a Subject Access Request within the statutory timeframe and failure to record the request)

## Document Consistency Rules
- Always ensure consistency across all related legal documents
- When updating one document, check for related information in other documents
- Use other documents as reference when making changes rather than assumptions
- Verify facts (like "pet deposit was applied to final rent" vs "never returned") across multiple documents
- When correcting a document, prioritize consistency with the main tribunal complaint document

## Factual Accuracy
- Be precise about how the pet deposit was handled (applied to final rent payment, not refused or withheld)
- Be specific about GDPR violations (failure to respond to SAR within one-month timeframe and failure to record the request)
- Distinguish between different types of data protection failures
- Verify all dates are consistent across documents (tenancy end date, check-out inventory date, etc.)

## Document Workflow
- HTML files are source files but not tracked in git (in .gitignore)
- PDF files are generated from HTML and are tracked in git
- Always run the convert_pdfs.py script after making changes to HTML files
- Check git repository location before attempting git operations (the git repo is in the professional_legal_documents directory)

## Legal Document Drafting
- Use precise language that matches legal terminology
- Maintain formal tone throughout all documents
- When describing financial transactions, be specific about what happened (e.g., "applied to rent" vs "refused to return")
- Cite specific articles of legislation being violated (e.g., Article 12(3) of UK GDPR)

## Version Control
- Commit messages should clearly describe what was changed and why
- Only commit the generated PDFs, not the HTML source files
- Check repository structure before attempting git operations
- Use git status to verify changes before committing

## Error Correction Process
1. Identify the discrepancy
2. Check all related documents to determine the correct information
3. Make minimal necessary changes to align documents
4. Regenerate PDFs using the conversion script
5. Commit and push only the necessary files

## Project Structure
- Main documents are in professional_legal_documents/main_documents/
- Supporting evidence is in professional_legal_documents/supporting_evidence/
- Tribunal submission documents are organized separately
- PDF conversion scripts are in the professional_legal_documents directory

## Lessons Learned
1. Always verify key facts across multiple documents before making changes
2. When correcting inconsistencies, look for the most authoritative document as the source of truth
3. Be careful not to introduce new inconsistencies when fixing existing ones
4. Use specific search terms to find all instances of a particular fact
5. When working with legal documents, precision in language is critical
6. Follow the established workflow for document updates (edit HTML → convert to PDF → commit PDF)
7. Check the repository structure before attempting git operations
