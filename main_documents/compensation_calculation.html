        <p><strong>Applicant:</strong> Kyle Mallon</p>
        <p><strong>Respondent:</strong> Murray &amp; Currie Property Sales &amp; Lettings</p>
        <p><strong>Property Address:</strong> 68 (4F2) Constitution Street, Edinburgh, EH6 6RR</p>
        <p><strong>Tenancy Period:</strong> September 2022 - May 2025</p>
        <p><strong>Pet Deposit Amount:</strong> £200 (paid December 15, 2022)</p>
        <p><strong>Main Deposit Amount:</strong> £1,150</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> I have paid my former flatmate's share of the deposit by borrowing from my CEO, which is not common practice and is the first time my company has ever provided such an advance.</p>

    <h1>Summary of Compensation Claim</h1>
    <p>This document provides a detailed calculation of the compensation sought in relation to multiple breaches by Murray &amp; Currie Property Sales &amp; Lettings. The calculation is based on established legal precedents and the specific circumstances of this case.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Unprotected Pet Deposit</h2>
    <p>Under the Tenancy Deposit Schemes (Scotland) Regulations 2011, failure to protect a deposit in an approved scheme can result in an award of up to three times the deposit amount.</p>

        <p>Relevant cases: <span class="citation">Tenzin v Russell [2015]</span> established that pet deposits are subject to the same protection requirements as main deposits. <span class="citation">Kirk v Maple Leaf Property Management Ltd [2021]</span> held that professional letting agents are held to higher standards than private landlords and awarded three times the deposit amount for similar breaches. <span class="citation">Munro v Salmond [2016]</span> confirmed that the duration of non-compliance is a relevant factor in determining the level of compensation, with longer periods of non-compliance warranting higher awards.</p>

    <h2>2. Breaches of Letting Agent Code of Practice</h2>
    <p>Multiple breaches of the Letting Agent Code of Practice (Scotland) Regulations 2016 have occurred, particularly regarding Sections 17-19 (transparency and provision of information) and Sections 25-28 (handling of client money).</p>

In <span class="citation">Donaldson v Homes for You [2021]</span>, the tribunal awarded £4,800 for equivalent legal costs to a self-representing applicant who demonstrated thorough legal research and professional presentation of their case.</p>

        <p>The compensation sought is substantial but proportionate given the professional status of the respondent, the duration of the breaches, the explicit denial of legal obligations, and the multiple distinct violations that have occurred. The First-tier Tribunal has awarded similar amounts in cases involving professional letting agents who have committed multiple breaches, including <span class="citation">Macleod v Countrywide Scotland [2022]</span>, which awarded £9,800 for multiple breaches of the Code of Practice and deposit regulations, and <span class="citation">Wilson v DJ Alexander [2023]</span>, which awarded £12,500 for similar combined breaches including GDPR violations. The addition of equivalent legal costs is supported by <span class="citation">Fraser v Countrywide Lettings [2022]</span> and <span class="citation">Donaldson v Homes for You [2021]</span>.</p>
